        Geometry of the cutting point
    dict_neighbors : dict ([CuttingPoint] -> list)
        Each cutting point has a dictionnary with his neighbors cutting points

    dist_on_roads : float
        Distance driven on road from the starting point to the point where we
        leave road for walking on trails to reach the cutting point.
    best_diff : float
        It is the minimal difficulty that we calculate for now to reach this
        cutting point.
    total_dist : float
        It is the distance travelled on trails before reaching the cutting
        point, for this current best_diff.
    total_elev_gain :  float
        This is the sum of the ascents climbed to reach the cutting point.

        This is the sum of the downward slope to reach the cutting point.
    is_connection_to_road : bool
        True if the cutting point is connecting a trail to a road.
